# STEM Mini Challenge Bot!

The goal of this bot is to send predefined STEM Mini competition to select Discord channels. Each competition will consist of one question that is answerable in the following format: button, dropdown, text input. Something to be aware of is the nearly synonymous language of **`challenge`** and **`competition`**. The user facing terms now use **`challenge`** in place of what was **`competition`**. In the code, **`competition`** is the same as a **`challenge`**. The modification to the terms was made after the bot was finished development and so functions, variables, interfaces, etc. will still use the **`competition`** terminology even though they are referring to **`challenges`**.

# Permissions

## 1. Required Bot Permissions

Grant it the following **Discord permissions**:

**Text Permissions**
✅ `View Channels` - Required to read messages in the channels.  
✅ `Send Messages` - Required to send messages and interactions.  
✅ `Send Messages in Threads` - If you want the bot to reply inside threads.  
✅ `Embed Links` - Allows the bot to send rich embeds.  
✅ `Attach Files` - Allows the bot to send images and files.  
✅ `Read Message History` - Needed to access past messages (e.g., checking prior questions).  
✅ `Use Slash Commands` - Required for slash commands.

**Message Management**
✅ `Manage Messages` - Required to delete messages.  

## **2. Where to Set These Permissions?**

There are **two places** where you must configure these permissions.

### **A) Discord Developer Portal (Bot Token & OAuth)**

1.  **Go to the Discord Developer Portal** → [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Select the bot ("Poller").
3.  Navigate to **OAuth2 > OAuth2 URL Generator**.
4.  Under **SCOPES**, select:
    -   `bot`
    -   `applications.commands` (required for slash commands)
5.  Scroll down to **BOT PERMISSIONS** and select the permissions mentioned above.
6.  Copy the generated **OAuth2 URL** and use it to invite your bot to the server.

### **B) Discord Server Settings (Per-Channel Permissions)**

1.  Go to your server.
2.  Navigate to each **channel**.
3.  Click on **Edit Channel** (⚙️ icon next to the channel).
4.  Go to **Permissions**.
5.  Add the **Poller** bot and explicitly grant it the necessary permissions.

## **3. Bot Token & .env File**

```
BOT_TOKEN=defined in Railway.
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
GUILD_ID=your-test-server-id-here
TARGET_CHANNELS=channels-to-receive-challenges,csv-if-more-than-one
```

If you need a new Bot token:
1.  Go to the Discord Developer Portal → [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2.  Select the bot ("Poller").
3.  Navigate to **Bot > Token > Reset Token**.
4. Paste this in the .env

🚨 **IMPORTANT** 🚨  
For the bot to send or receive any messages, you must define:
- One and only one **`GUILD_ID`**.
- At least one value for **`TARGET_CHANNELS`**.

The bot is currently restricted to **admin role only** in Discord. To modify this, update the `.env` file:

- Set `PERMITTED_ROLE` to the **role ID** of the desired role (only one may be used).

# Running the Bot

This bot is currently hosted on **Railway** under the project name **`mini-challenge-bot`**. It runs using the **bun** package manager.

### Running the Bot Locally

To run the bot locally, pull the project repository

> `bun install`
>
> `bun run dev`

### Command Management
This Discord bot is triggered with slash commands, these are:
-   Defined in individual files under `src/commands/`. If you add new commands, follow the naming convention of the file name being the command's name. (ex: `/minibatch` -> `mini-batch.ts`)
-   Registered with Discord in `src/register-commands.ts`.

If you modify any command files or `register-commands.ts`, you must re-register the commands:

> `bun run src/register-commands.ts`

If running locally, restart the bot after registering commands. You shouldn't need to manually run the register command since that is included in the `dev` script. Just be aware that this registration needs to happen.

### Deploying Updates

Railway automatically redeploys the bot when updates are pushed to the main branch, so you should not need to worry about manually registering new commands in production. However, if newly created or modified commands do not appear in Discord or do not function as expected, verify they have been properly registered.

# Build the Season's Challenges

To prepare a mini challenge, use the interface below to define the object. This is currently the only way to add/update/delete challenges for the season.

```
type Category = "Cybersecurity" | "Digital Marketing" | "Data Science"

type InputType = "button" | "dropdown" | "text" | "image"

interface Competition {
  name: string
  week: number
  category: Category
  instructions: string
  image?: string
  prompt?: string
  inputType: InputType
  options?: string[]
  correctAnswer?: string | string[]
  onSuccessMessage?: string
  onWrongMessage?: string
}
```

In order to set the competitions for a given period of time, you will assemble an array of type `Competition[]` where each object is a respective competition

```
const  competitions:  Competition[] = [
	{
		name:  "Sus or Trust",
		week:  1,
		category:  "Cyber",
		instructions: formatCompInstructions(
      		1,
      		"cybersecurity",
      		"Decide if the password is **TRUSTworthy** or **SUSworthy**. In other words, would you trust this password to protect your data or Nah?"
    	),
		prompt:  "**Password:** P@ssw0rd123",
		inputType:  "button",
		options: ["Trust", "Sus"],
		correctAnswer:  "Sus",
		onSuccessMessage:  "🎉 You got it! P@ssw0rd123 is a TRUST-worthy password!",
		onWrongMessage:  "❌ Oops! That password isn't strong enough!",
	},
	{
		name:  "Build a Logo",
		week:  1,
		category:  "Digital Marketing",
		instructions: formatCompInstructions(
      		1,
      		"digitalMarketing",
      		"Create a logo for our company's new brand Fuhll Stahch"
    	),
		image:
		"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/02/09/learning/LebronGraphLN2/LebronGraphLN2-
		superJumbo.png?quality=75&auto=webp",
		inputType:  "image",
	},

	...//
]
```

## A few things to note

All text that is to be displayed in a discord message, MAY be formatted using Markdown if you want. Include all of the styles in the strings and they will be rendered accordingly. Here is a helpful markdwon editor that I used: [boom, said markdown editor](https://stackedit.io/app#)

**Formatting instructions:**

The function `formatCompInstructions(...//)` is used to ensure consistent formatting of all mini comp headers. You do not have to use this but unless you want to create a specific header, make the modifications inside the aforementioned function directly, since that will be applied to all header from then on out.

**Success/Failure messages:** The `copmetition.on_____Message:` keys are optional. There are currently two default messages that the bot will send if you do not include a custom response (`src/messages/bot-response.ts`):

> onSuccessMessage: "✅ Nice work, you're crushing it! 🎉"
>
> onWrongMessage: `❌ Incorrect answer. The correct answer was: **${correctAnswer}**.`

The `Competition.options:` MUST be included if you choose either `button` or `dropdown` for the `Competition.inputType`. The bot will not work if that array is empty.

> "button" requires TWO options
>
> "dropdown" requires AT LEAST ONE option

**Input Type:** The `inputType` decides the type of response the user is asked to use. `Buttons` and `Dropdown` REQUIRE `options` since the students may only select from what is provided. `Text` and `Image` are open to how the student wants to respond.

**Correct Answer:** If your mini challenge has a correct answer, make sure to include the `correctAnswer` key in your competition object. This is what the student's asnwers will be compared against.

**Image:** The `image` value will be displayed with the instructions. You can see this implemented in the first two weeks of Data Science challenges: I send a graph along with the instructions.

**Prompt:** The `prompt` value will be displayed as an embeded block. This is good for any text block/s you want to stand out or that are over 2,000 characters (see Cyber security week 3 "Phind the Phish").


# Using the Bot

Use one of the two slash commands `/start` or `/minibatch` followed by two arguments `{week #} {competition category}`, defining which of your predefined competitions you want to send.

1. `/start` sends a challenge to the channel in which the command is run
2. `/minibatch` sends a challenge to each of the predefined channels

ex: `/minibatch 1 Cybersecurity`

# Collecting responses

ALL response by students with the mini comps will be captured and POSTed to the Bubble DB. Currently there is a Data Type named `MINI_COMP_BOT_RESPONSES`, it is updated from `/src/udpate-bubble.ts`. At the moment the data collected from the students is the following:

```
{
  server
  channel
  competition_title
  competition_week
  interaction_snowflake // id student's interaction
  discord_snowflake // student's discord ID
  text_response // if student responds using buttons, text input, dropdown
  image_response // if the student responds with an image
}
```
